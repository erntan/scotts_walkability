# Design Process
This document outlines the project definition and creation phases. Please see [`README.md`](README.md) for the final project outline.

## Identify
### Problem statements
1. Scottsdale is (feels?) dangerous to commute by walking.
2. Scottsdale is unpleasant to walk in because of the noise/fast traffic (forcing you to always be on alert/pay attention).
3. It is very inconvenient/cumbersome to walk anywhere in Scottsdale because you have to cross many lanes of fast-moving traffic and crosswalks are few and far between.

### How can we. . . 
1. Make Scottsdale more fun/pleasant to walk in?
2. Make walking more desirable than driving in Scottsdale?
3. Make Scottsdale safer to walk in?
4. Motivate people to walk in Scottsdale?

## Immerse
<!-- ### Research questions -->
* Is Scottsdale really more dangerous to walk in?
  - [ ] Research statistics.
* How do people feel about Scottsdale's walkability? 
  - [x] What do *I* feel makes it inconvenient/unsafe/unpleasant to walk in Scottsdale? [Priority List](C:\Users\Ern\Documents\projects\scotts_walkability\research\r_case_self.md)
* Is it really that inconvenient to walk in Scottsdale? [Research](C:\Users\Ern\Documents\projects\scotts_walkability\research\safety.rmd)
  - [ ] Research average number of lanes needed to cross, etc.
  - [ ] Research average distance to nearest crosswalk, etc.
