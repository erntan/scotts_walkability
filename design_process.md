This document outlines the project definition and creation phases. Please see [`README.md`](README.md) for the final project outline.

## Identify
### Problem statements
1. Scottsdale is (feels?) dangerous to commute by walking.
2. Scottsdale is unpleasant to walk in because of the noise/fast traffic (forcing you to always be on alert/pay attention).
3. It is very inconvenient/cumbersome to walk anywhere in Scottsdale because you have to cross many lanes of fast-moving traffic and crosswalks are few and far between.

### How can we. . . 
1. Make Scottsdale more fun/pleasant to walk in?
2. Make walking more desirable than driving in Scottsdale?
3. Make Scottsdale safer to walk in?
4. Motivate people to walk in Scottsdale?
